    "**iNNvestigate** got created to make analyzing neural network's predictions easy! The library should help the user to focus on research and development by providing implemented analysis methods and facilitating rapid development of new methods. In this notebook we will show you how to use **iNNvestigate** and for a better understanding we recommend to read [iNNvestigate neural networks!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04260) first! How to use **iNNvestigate** you can read in this notebook: [Developing with iNNvestigate](introduction_development.ipynb)\n",

    "The field of analyizing neural network's predictions is about gaining insights how and why a potentially complex network gave as output a certain value or choose a certain class over others. This is often called interpretability or explanation of neural networks. We just call it analyzing a neural network's prediction to be as neutral as possible and to leave any conclusions to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most methods have in common that they analyze the input features w.r.t. a specific neuron's output. Which insights a method reveals about this output can be grouped into (see [Learning how to explain: PatternNet and PatternAttribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05598)):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **function:** analyzing the operations the network function uses to extract or compute the output. E.g., how would changing an input feature change the output.\n",
    "* **signal:** analyzing the components of the input that cause the output. E.g., which parts of an input image or which directions of an input are used to determine the output.\n",
    "* **attribution:** attributing the \"importance\" of input features for the output. E.g., how much would changing an input feature change the output.\n",
